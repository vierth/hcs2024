. 1. Confucius said, 'Contemplating good, and pursuing it, as if they could not reach it; contemplating evil, and shrinking from it, as they would from thrusting the hand into boiling water:-- I have seen such men, as I have heard such words. 2. 'Living in retirement to study their aims, and practising righteousness to carry out their principles:-- I have heard these words, but I have not seen such men.'
